        My favorite way to spent the time, most of the time i read  fantasy book but
        some other time i like to read a book about self-education/help.
        3 of my most favorite books are Atomic Habits by James Clear,
        The Art of Not Giving A F by Mark Manson, and One Piece by Eiichiro Oda.
